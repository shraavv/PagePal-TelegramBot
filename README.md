# Gopal and his PagePal

Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Botcity, there lived a young book enthusiast named Gopal. Gopal had a deep passion for reading, and his favorite pastime was immersing himself in the enchanting world of books. However, there was one dilemma that troubled him constantly, finding books of his favorite genre. Inspired by his struggle, Gopal conceived the idea of developing a chatbot called PagePal. This bot would assist him in searching for books by genre and provide him with a curated list of recommendations. Unfortunately, Gopal's lack of programming skills proved to be a significant obstacle in bringing his vision to fruition. 

As a programmer, help _Gopal_ in uniting him with his _PagePal!_

Create a book recommendation telegram bot that displays a list of books with details like Book title, author, description, year published (originally), language and preview (if available) when the user types in the genre of the book they want to read. 

Feel free to customize your PagePal!

# Primary Features

- Before you start coding, set up your **python virtual environment**. This is an important step and always remember, Google is your friend :)
- The bot should have three basic commands:
  - ```/start``` returns a welcome message to the user
  - ```/book``` asks the user to type in the genre
  - ```/help``` returns the list of commands with their description
- When the ```/book``` command is typed in, the user is asked to enter the genre name, upon which the user types in the name and the bot returns a CSV file with different book names. The CSV file should have different columns for each detail.
